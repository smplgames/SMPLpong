## How to play
The game can be played by **up to 4 players** simultaneously. 

Your goal here is to use up the lives of the other team or player before your own lives are used up. As known from classical Pong, you achieve this by directing the ball into the opponent's field. In between, obstacles and power-ups appear on the playing field, which bring the game action to a new stress level for all players. 

**Enjoy the battle!**
